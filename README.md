This repository contains an end-to-end solution to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** challenge on Kaggle. The objective of the challenge is to predict passenger survival based on various demographic and contextual features, such as age, sex, class, fare, and more. The solution leverages a variety of machine learning techniques to preprocess, train, and evaluate a robust predictive model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a Titanic passenger survived or perished, given a set of features. The process involves rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to ensure high model performance and generalizability on unseen data.

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - **Data Loading & Inspection**: Import the Titanic dataset and perform an initial examination to identify missing data and feature distributions.
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values are either imputed using statistical methods or removed based on the significance of the missingness.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' are transformed into numeric representations using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features (e.g., 'Fare', 'Age') are standardized using Min-Max scaling to ensure consistent input range across models.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

   - **Extracting Titles from Names**: The 'Name' field is parsed to extract titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss), which are then used as additional categorical features for modeling.
   - **Age Binning**: Age is discretized into age groups to help capture non-linear relationships with survival outcomes.
   - **Family Size**: A new feature, 'FamilySize', is created by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch', capturing family-related dynamics that could influence survival probability.

### 3. **Model Selection & Training**

   - Multiple machine learning models are trained and compared, including:
     - **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable model that serves as a baseline.
     - **Decision Trees**: A non-linear model capable of capturing complex feature interactions.
     - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method based on multiple decision trees, ideal for handling high-dimensional data with complex patterns.
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A robust method that can effectively separate classes in high-dimensional spaces.
   - Cross-validation is performed to evaluate each model's performance and reduce the risk of overfitting.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**

   - **Metrics**: The models are evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Randomized search and grid search are utilized to fine-tune model hyperparameters, aiming to improve performance and avoid overfitting.
   - **Model Selection**: The final model is selected based on the highest F1-score and cross-validation results, ensuring a balance between precision and recall.

### 5. **Final Model & Prediction**

   - The model with the best performance is used to make predictions on the test set.
   - Predictions are submitted to the Kaggle competition for evaluation, which is scored on the basis of accuracy.
